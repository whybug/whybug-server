### Side-effects

There are two possibilities to integrate external systems like databases, APIs etc.

 1. **Action handler**
 
    Synchronous integration. If changes have to be available immediately or only 
    executed once use an action handler.
 
 2. **Event handler**
 
    Asynchronous integration.
